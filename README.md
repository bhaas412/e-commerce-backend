# E-Commerce Backend

## Description

This E-Commerce Backend project was a completion of the backend for an already provided Express.js API. Sequelize and MySQL were used in order to model and interact with the MySQL database through the API.

Once the Express.js server is started with the seeded MySQL database, you can use the API routes (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform RESTful CRUD operations on the database. This can be done easily using an API client such as Insomnia.

In this walkthrough video, first I show the project's backend code and that it properly satisfies the technical acceptance criteria for everything server-side (models, API routes, Express.js and Sequelize functionality, etc.). Then, once I run the server, I use Insomnia to demonstrate that all the API routes work as intended and that data is properly stored and manipulated in the MySQL database.
